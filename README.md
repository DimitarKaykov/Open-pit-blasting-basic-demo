# Open-pit-blasting-basic-demo
This is a basic example of an open-pit blast design optimization problem with a twist. Repository includes three notebooks, each labeled as Vol. 1, 2 and 3. 
- Vol. 1 serves an introduction to the problem. 
- Vol. 2 provides a general demonstration of how a blast design optimization problem can be formulated and how few basic algorithm work to solve it. For novice engineers, please note the performance of these algorithms.
- Vol. 3 provides an example of using a stochatic approach to the blast design optimization problem, assuming the UCS value of the blasted rock is pre-sampled and inferred to the rock mass of interest.

This repository serves for demonstration purposes. Try experimenting on your own!
